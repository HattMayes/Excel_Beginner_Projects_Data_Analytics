## Project 1 - Salary Dashboard  
This Job Salary dashboard was created using data from over 30,000 job postings collated by Luke Barousse. The jobs are global listings and thus contain information relating to the job title, the country it is advertised for, and what type of contract the job listing is. The video below shows how the interactive dashboard can be used to change these filters in order to review the median salary, top job platform, and the job count for multiple or specific data roles.

## Project 2 - Salary Analysis  
The Salary Analysis project allowed me to introduce the use of PivotTables and PivotCharts to visualise how the number of skills affected the salary of a job, as well as what skills correlated to higher pay for data jobs. I was also able to introduce slicers to make filtering jobs and countries more efficient.
